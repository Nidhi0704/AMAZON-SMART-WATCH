# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Smart Watch Price Prediction üìä

## üìö Overview

This project aims to predict the price of smart watches using a regression model. The workflow involves:

1. **Data Scraping**: Collecting raw data from the Amazon website.
2. **Data Processing**: Cleaning and preprocessing the data.
3. **Model Training**: Building a regression model to predict prices.
4. **Web Application**: Creating an interactive Flask web app to display predictions.
